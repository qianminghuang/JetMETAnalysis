JetMETAnalysis
==============

The code contained in this package is used for creating and analyzing the L2Relative and L3Absolute jet energy corrections (JEC). The code is used by the Jet Energy Resolution and Corrections (JERC) subgroup.

The JetAnalyzers subpackage relies upon the JetUtilities subpackage.

The JetUtilities subpackage contains useful tools and plugins for the JetMETAnalysis-JetAnalyzers package, but they can also be used outside of the JetAnalyzers framework (i.e. CommandLine tools).
